# MyPortfolio
This is a demo portfolio website which I created by using HTML , CSS and Js. I uploaded my own design work here, so you can enjoy while watching my website. I included a gallery slide which changes every two seconds automatically. User also can manually navigate through the images by using given buttons below. It also have a little fade in animation for several parts of the website. 

You can click on any image in the image grid and get the details of the image.And also you can fill out the form and see the message yourself. :d
